# PROJECT NAME: NEWS EXPLORER

##

### **`DESCRIPTION:`**

### This is the backend of the custom project called "News Explorer" created by Brandon Dooley.

================================================================================================

### **`TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES:`**

### The frontend application has quite a bit more features. This side of the project has a variety of functions that base around typical information expected from news articles. There is also the added functions of "likes" and "favorites." The idea of the "likes" is to give people access to filtered results by the community. The api's used call a variety of news sources and present in sometimes terrible fashion. Also, those api's don't always function correctly, so sometimes if a user is looking for something it can be helpful having a centralized database created through the interest of others. Then the "favorited" part gives users even more control over their interests just in case the news api's remove the content they like. This part of the project also has the ability for users to sign in, register, and update their information.

### Schemas are used to force content to be in a certain format before the server will accept it, adding a certain level of security to multiple facets. Mongoose is used as the storage medium.

### **`DEPLOYMENT:`**

### This website can be accessed at the following link: (https://www.newsexplorer.justlearning.net/). Note, some service providers might block this because justlearning.net is a public domain, which could be used by hackers to create ficticious sites and attack people. On Spectrum, I had to temporarily turn off the Security Shield.

### Both the frontend and backend files can be accessed here (https://github.com/BigRedCoding/FinalProject). These can be downloaded and ran locally. When you're in VS Code, using "npm install" for dependecies and "npm run dev" on both should allow local use.

### **`Video Demonstration:`**

### For the moment, I will wait on this until the project is complete.
