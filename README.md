# PROJECT NAME: NEWS EXPLORER

##

### **`DESCRIPTION:`**

### This is the backend of the custom project called "News Explorer" created by Brandon Dooley.

================================================================================================

### **`TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES:`**

### The frontend application has quite a bit more features. This side of the project has a variety of functions that base around typical information expected from news articles. There is also the added functions of "likes" and "favorites." The idea of the "likes" is to give people access to filtered results by the community. The api's used call a variety of news sources and present in sometimes terrible fashion. Also, those api's don't always function correctly, so sometimes if a user is looking for something it can be helpful having a centralized database created through the interest of others. Then the "favorited" part gives users even more control over their interests just in case the news api's remove the content they like. This part of the project also has the ability for users to sign in, register, and update their information.

### Schemas are used to force content to be in a certain format before the server will accept it, adding a certain level of security to multiple facets. Mongoose is used as the storage medium.

### **`DEPLOYMENT:`**

### THIS IS NOT COMPLETE

### This website is desployed on GitHub at the following link: [here](https://bigredcoding.github.io/se_project_react/)

### I have recently updated this site to be reliant on a custom backend server I've created. In this project's "api.js", there is a variable called "baseUrl" and it is set to a local address that is targeted when the server is ran with the command "npm run dev." You can find this custom server at the following link: [here](https://github.com/BigRedCoding/se_project_express)

### **`Video Demonstration:`**

### For the moment, I will wait on this until the project is complete.
